Prompt 1:
"Design a native durable execution engine in Java inspired by Temporal and Azure Durable Functions. 
The engine should support step memoization, crash recovery, sequence tracking, and concurrency 
using standard Java constructs and an RDBMS for persistence."

Prompt 2:
"Explain how to implement exactly-once execution semantics for side-effecting operations 
using a step abstraction and persistent storage."

Prompt 3:
"Suggest a clean Java API for a step primitive that allows normal Java code 
(loops, conditionals, CompletableFuture-based concurrency) to become durable."

Prompt 4:
"How can zombie steps (crash between execution and commit) be detected and safely handled 
in a durable workflow system?"

Prompt 5:
"Provide guidance on structuring a Maven-based Java project for a durable workflow engine, 
including persistence, concurrency handling, and CLI-based workflow execution."
